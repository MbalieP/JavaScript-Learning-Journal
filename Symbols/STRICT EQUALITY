// Assignment operator (=): Assigns a value to a variable
// Comparison operator (==): Checks if two values are equal, type coercion is allowed
// Strict equality operator (===): Checks if two values are equal and of the same type (no type coercion)
// Inequality operator (!=): Checks if two values are not equal, type coercion is allowed
// Strict inequality operator (!==): Checks if two values are not equal and/or not of the same type

const PI = 3.14; // Assigning the value of Pi to a constant variable

// Check if the value of PI is strictly equal to the string "3.14"
if (PI === "3.14") {
    console.log("That is NOT Pi"); // This block executes if the condition is true
} else {
    console.log("That is Pi"); // This block executes if the condition is false
}

// Additional Information =:
// - Using the strict equality operator (===) is generally recommended to avoid unexpected type coercion.
// - In this case, the condition evaluates to false because the number 3.14 (number type) is not the same as "3.14" (string type).
// - Always prefer strict comparisons to ensure both value and type match, which leads to more predictable code behavior.

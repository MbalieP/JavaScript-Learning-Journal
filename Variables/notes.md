# Day 1: JavaScript Variables

## What I Learned
- How to declare variables using `var`, `let`, and `const`
- `let` is block scoped and preferred over `var`
- `const` is used for constants (can't be reassigned)

## Code Example
```javascript
let name = "Mbali";
const country = "South Africa";
var age = 25;

console.log(name, country, age);
